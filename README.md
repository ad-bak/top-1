# HTML Tables - Odin Project Challenge

## Overview

This project is a part of the Odin Project's curriculum and focuses on understanding and implementing HTML tables. It's a simple challenge that I undertook to refresh my skills during my free time. While it's a basic project, it's always beneficial to revisit the fundamentals, as they lay the foundation for more complex concepts.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Revisit the concept and usage of HTML tables.
- Refresh knowledge on creating advanced HTML tables.
- Recall why it's not a good idea to use HTML tables for page layout.
- Review the usage of caption elements and the scope attribute in HTML tables.

## Project Status

This project is complete.

## Implementation

The project was implemented following the guidelines and assignments provided by the Odin Project. The Tables Basics and Tables Advanced tutorials from MDN were used as primary learning resources. The knowledge gained was then put into practice by completing the Tables Assessment from MDN.

## Reflection

This project served as a great refresher on the specifics of HTML tables. It's always good to revisit the basics, as it strengthens the understanding of more complex concepts. The challenge of the assessment allowed for practical application of the concepts learned.
